      <description>Hello there. If you read my blog before, you may wonder where are all other posts. Well, they are gone. Iâ€™ve moved to new blog platform called Hugo and decided to make a fresh start. There were a couple of good articles here but time goes by and they are not quite relevant for today. When I see a fresh blog I want to full it with some new content so it gives me more motivation to write new blog posts here.</description>
