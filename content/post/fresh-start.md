Hello there. If you read my blog before, you may wonder where are all other posts. Well, they are gone. I’ve moved to new blog platform called [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and decided to make a fresh start. There were a couple of good articles here but time goes by and they are not quite relevant for today. When I see a fresh blog I want to full it with some new content so it gives me more motivation to write new blog posts here. 

## Topics 

I’m going to keep technical specialization of this blog and will add a bit of management and life balance posts. As for technical topics I’m going to write more posts for people with some technical background. I will also try to give explanations so it should be clear for new programmers too. My plans about the technical topics are iOS mobile platform and machine learning. It’s very interesting and exiting field. I can’t wait to share with you all the interesting information that I have. And also there are good news for my Russian speaking friends. Hugo support multi language support. This means that here will be content in Russian as in English. Sounds good, right? Of course, I'll follow a good tech blogger tradition and share my new blog setup. So you will be able to creat your own blog on hugo engine if you'll want to. 

## One more thing... 

In nearest future I plan to start a new project based on my blog. I hope you’ll like it. So, stay tuned and happy coding!
